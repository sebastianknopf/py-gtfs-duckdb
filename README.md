# GTFS-DuckDB
This package provides several python utilities to read, aggregate, merge, modify and export [GTFS](https://gtfs.org/) compliant static and realtime data. The package works without any database server using a [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).

## Core Functionaliy
GTFS-DuckDB supports several core functionalities, described as follows:

- Load and merge ("drop") GTFS static feeds: Several GTFS static feeds can be loaded and merged using different [strategies](docs/STRATEGIES.md). Even huge GTFS feeds (e.g. whole Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg) are working properly.
- Remove unwanted agencies, routes or trips and their related objects
- Execute SQL statements on the GTFS data directly
- Export modified and merged GTFS datasets
- Grabbing up realtime data and match them against the loaded static data. Matched realtime data are exposed with GTFS-RT endpoints providing a GTFS-RT server.

The functionalities are used in production and also tested in a working GoogleMaps integration.

See [commands cheat-sheet](docs/COMMANDS.md) for reference how to use the GTFS-DuckDB.
